            of the movies you're anticipating to watch, whether the films haven't been released yet or you don't have the time to watch them yet, can be 
            tricky. We are here to help solve those problems with Ultimate Movie Tracker! After creating an account, you will have full access to our 
            amazing services. You will be able to have a "To-Do" styled Watchlist where you'll be prompted to enter in any movies of your choosing, and 
            be able to add any notes for it if you wish. After watching any film provided on your Watchlist, feel free to checkmark it, marking it as "watched", 
            and become a critic by adding your own review in the notes section! These lists are special and only for you, as only the account holder may see 
            and modify their own Watchlist in anyway. <br> We are so happy you're here and excited to help you with such a fun activity! So what are you waiting for?! Go ahead and create an account and get started!
            Keep visitng back for future developer updates to add more to your experience! :D
